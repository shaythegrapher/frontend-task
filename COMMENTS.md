## What I built
- Replaced the hardcoded fixture with live API data.
- Implemented pagination with a "Load More" button.
- Used the Link header to determine when additional pages are available.
- Integrated the pre-styled Button component for consistency with the design system.
- Matched layout and typography with the Figma design.
- Displayed loan amounts with a £ prefix and formatted them with comma separators for readability.
- Formatted application and expiry dates into a user-friendly dd-mm-yyyy format.
- Introduced TypeScript types in the areas I worked on for stronger type safety.
- Added a basic Vitest test to ensure the component renders and the "Load More" button appears.

## What I’d improve with more time
- Add loading indicators and error states to improve user experience.
- Expand test coverage using Vitest to cover rendering, pagination, and error handling.
- Enhance mobile responsiveness and refine styling for smaller viewports.
- Improve accessibility with ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML.
